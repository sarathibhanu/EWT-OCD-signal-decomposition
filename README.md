##  Abstract
The paper presents a novel technique that integrates the **Over-complete Dictionary (OCD)** with **Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT)** to effectively decompose signals containing abrupt changes. The approach addresses the limitations of standard EWT by removing spikes before decomposition, enabling accurate spectral and structural analysis across **1D signals (ECG, EEG, EMG, seismic, speech)** and **2D images (chest X-ray, CT, histopathology, retinal fundus, remote sensing)**.  
The framework significantly improves quantitative metrics such as **PSNR, SSIM, SNR, and SQI**, proving effective for **biomedical diagnostics, seismic analysis, and environmental monitoring**.
